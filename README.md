# 🌱 PlantIQ8A1  
**Open-source Intelligent Plant Care Advisor**

> A fully web-based, multilingual, IoT-integrated plant diagnosis and advisory system powered by generative AI.  
> Built for everyone — from students, farmers to bonsai hobbyists! 🧑‍🌾👩‍🎓👨‍🔬

---

## 📖 About the Project

**PlantIQ8A1** is a 100% open-source, AI-powered web system that helps users analyze plant images, diagnose issues (e.g. yellowing leaves 🌿), and receive care advice via natural conversation. Designed with ease-of-use and accessibility in mind, especially for non-technical users and school environments.

> ✅ No installation required  (web only and for desktop/mobile - Mobile support will be added gradually)
> 🧠 Fully automatic, real-time plant care advisor  
> 📸 AI Image Analysis + 💬 Natural language responses  
> 🌐 IoT-powered: humidity, temperature, and GPS-aware reasoning

---

## ✨ Core Features

- 📸 **Image Analysis** — Upload plant images and receive instant AI diagnosis using `vision-lite`
- 💬 **AI Advisor Chat** — Built with `plantiq8a1-deepthink-lite`, answers plant care questions with empathy and clarity
- 🔁 **Self-learning AI** — Models improve continuously via user feedback (zero human assistance - server only not open source)
- 🌐 **IoT Integration** — Real-time weather, humidity, and GPS data help refine recommendations *(enabled in all models - server only not open source)*
- 🧪 **Multi-mode Reasoning** — Includes Basic and Reasoning modes
